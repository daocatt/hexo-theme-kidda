## Install

1. Download from GitHub
```shell

```
2. Set the `theme` field in **your site** `_config.yml` to `kidda`
```yml
theme: kidda
```
3. ❤️ Install dependencies.  
The template is written in pug. So you need to install `hexo-render-pug`.

# Install your all dependencies if you didn't do this before.
$ npm i
```
